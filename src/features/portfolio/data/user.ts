  // With 5+ years of experience, I specialize in building high-quality web and mobile applications using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and modern front-end technologies. Beyond work, I love exploring new technologies and turning ideas into reality through personal projects.

  // One of my key projects, [ZaDark](https://zadark.com), launched in 2022, enhances the Zalo experience on PC and Web, surpassing 80k+ downloads on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/zadark) and reaching 20k+ active users on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/llfhpkkeljlgnjgkholeppfnepmjppob) (as of Sep 2025).

  // I'm also the creator of [React Wheel Picker](https://react-wheel-picker.chanhdai.com) — iOS-like wheel picker for React with smooth inertia scrolling and infinite loop support. It has earned 4k+ weekly downloads on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ncdai/react-wheel-picker) and was selected for [▲Vercel OSS Program](https://vercel.com/blog/summer-2025-oss-program#react-wheel-picker) summer 2025 cohort.
