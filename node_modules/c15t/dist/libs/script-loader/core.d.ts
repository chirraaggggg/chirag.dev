 * @param scriptIdMap - Map of anonymized script IDs to original IDs
 * @returns Array of script IDs that were loaded
 *
 * @throws {Error} When a script with the same ID is already loaded
 *
 * @remarks
 * The loading process follows these steps:
 * 1. Check if the script has consent to load (skipped if alwaysLoad is true)
 * 2. Check if the script is already loaded
 * 3. Create the script element with all specified attributes
 * 4. Apply ID anonymization if enabled (default behavior)
 * 5. Execute the `onBeforeLoad` callback if provided
 * 6. Add the script to the document
 * 7. Track the loaded script
 *
 * Scripts with `alwaysLoad: true` will bypass consent checks and load immediately.
 * This is useful for scripts like Google Tag Manager that manage their own consent.
 *
 * When anonymizeId is enabled (default), script elements will use randomly generated IDs
 * instead of the original script IDs prefixed with 'c15t-script-'.
