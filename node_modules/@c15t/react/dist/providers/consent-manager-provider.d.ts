 * - Creating a consent manager from the provided options
 * - Detecting user's region for compliance
 * - Managing consent state updates
 * - Providing access to consent management throughout the app
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * <ConsentManagerProvider
 *   options={{
 *     mode: 'offline',
 *     callbacks: {
 *       onConsentSet: (response) => console.log('Consent updated')
 *     }
 *   }}
 * >
 *   {children}
 * </ConsentManagerProvider>
