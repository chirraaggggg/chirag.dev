 * c15t Types Package
 *
 * This package provides type definitions specific to the c15t consent management system.
 * It extends the base DoubleTie framework types with consent management specific functionality.
 *
 * The types in this folder should be used for consent management specific features, while
 * more generic SDK functionality should remain in the DoubleTie base types.
