/**
 * This component is used to provide options to the consent manager on the client side.
 * This is seperate from the ConsentManagerProvider component because options like callbacks and scripts can't be seralized.
 * If you want a fully client-side solution, you can use the <ConsentManagerProvider /> component from @c15t/nextjs/client.
 *
 * @param children - The children to render.
 * @param callbacks - The callbacks to set.
 * @param scripts - The scripts to load.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This component performs one-time initialization on mount. Callbacks and scripts are captured
 * once when the component first mounts and are not updated on subsequent prop changes. This
 * ensures stable behavior and prevents inconsistent state in the consent manager.
 * You can pass inline objects without needing to wrap them in useMemo.
